# What is ShiftOS?

ShiftOS was a game developed by Australian YouTuber [Philip Adams](https://www.youtube.com/user/OsFirstTimer).  This game had the player thrown into an experimental operating system called -- you guessed it -- **ShiftOS** where the goal was to earn *Codepoints* by using the OS so you could upgrade and evolve it with new programs, GUI elements, and other features & capabilities.  It was developed from 2013 to 2014 by Phil, and from 2014 to 2017 by the community with [Michael VanOverbeek](https://alkalinethunder.github.io/) leading development from 2015 and onwards.

This project aims to bring some of the features from the in-game operating system to a real-life Linux distribution where we feel they would be more appropriate.

## Main features

 - **Shiftorium:** In the game, this was where you would exchange Codepoints for system upgrades such as new programs.  In this distribution, it will serve as a unified Arch Linux package manager and AUR helper.

 - **Shifter:** This was the in-game program allowing COMPLETE customization of the operating system and its user interface all in one place.  We'll be bringing this over in the form of many different components built into one program - GTK theme editor, plymouth boot screen editor, grub theme editor, and more.

 - **Skin Loader:** In the game this was the utility that allowed loading and saving of Shifter configurations in the form of .skn files.  Users could share these on the ShiftOS forum for other users to use.  This will be the exact same in this distribution.

 - **Pong:** It's exactly what you think it is.

## Why Arch?

If you haven't figured this out already, ShiftOS is going to be built ontop of [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/).  Why?  Because Arch itself is already super customizable, and incredibly light-weight.  While distributions such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint are very user-friendly, it is a fair bit more difficult to get the same level of customization and power we'd need to pull a project like this off.  ShiftOS as a game was incredibly weird as far as fake OSes go, and had a lot of unconventional features.  Moreover, ShiftOS would've originally been an Arch distribution that completely changed how it looks every reboot.  While that idea definitely wouldn't be feasible, this will be.

## How to contribute

The source Archiso configuration can be found here:

> [shiftos-linux / shiftos](https://github.com/shiftos-linux/shiftos)

You'll need an existing Arch installation to build the ISO image from source.
